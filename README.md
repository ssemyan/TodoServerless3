# TodoServerless3 - Azure Functions Todo List Sample

This sample demonstrates a simple single page application web frontend and Azure Functions 2.0 API backend. It uses Azure Table Storage to store data. Authentication is Azure Active Directory (v1 of the API) using the ADAL library - https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js/wiki

This code can be run locally (using the Azure Functions CLI and Azure Storage emulator) as well as in Azure. Instructions for both are below.

The application is a simple Todo list where users can add items "todo". The items are stored in a single Azure Storage Table. Each user can only access their items (user identification is via the claims from the authentication mechanism). 

Note: the UI will show the email of the currently logged in user (from the token obtained by the ADAL library), and the Function will return the username of the currently logged in user in the function (from the claims) which is shown at the top of the table. 

The UI is very simple with Bootstrap for styles, Knockout.js for data binding, and jQuery for ajax calls. 

Users can add new items to their list or mark existing items as complete (which deletes them). The initial call to the API pulls the current list of items for the user, along with the user's display name (from the Auth Claims). 

This sample is similar to https://github.com/ssemyan/TodoServerless but uses Functions 2.0 and instead of serving the content from a storage account via a proxy, it uses an App Service to host the HTML and JS. 

This sample is also similar to https://github.com/ssemyan/TodoServerless2 but it uses Azure Storage Tables instead of Cosmos DB (for simplicity) and it only has Authentication enabled on the API, not the front-end web app (thus it does not need to do user impersonation).  

Note: the connection string to the storage account is automatically added to the Functions app. Another approach would be to use Managed Service Identity and retrieve it from a KeyVault using the technique described here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references

## Setup steps on Localhost

1. Install the Azure CLI tools from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local

1. If you want to use the emulator for local development, install the Storage emulator from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator

1. If you are not using the emulator, create a storage account in Azure. 

1. Update the connection string in **_local.settings.json_** to the one for the emulator or Azure

1. Right click the solution, choose properties, and set the UI and API project to start. 

## Setup steps on Azure - Manual

1. Create a storage account

1. Create a new Azure App Service for the UI

1. Create a new Azure Functions app (sharing the App Service Plan with the UI if desired)

1. Add a CORS setting in the Azure Functions app to allow origins from the App Service

1. Set up Authentication using either the Express or Advanced method and ensure the Application Registration in AAD has the URL for the UI in the Redirect URIs and ID Tokens are enabled. This is described here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad

## Setup steps on Azure - Automated using ARM Template

1. Create a resource group to hold the resources. For example: 

```
New-AzResourceGroup -Name mygroup -Location westeurope
```

1. Create an Application Registration in AAD and ensure the URL for the UI in the Redirect URIs and ID Tokens are enabled. This is described here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad

1. Update the values in the *parameter.json* file to match your values: 
    * *web_ui_name* (app service for the UI)
    * *web_api_name* (app service for the API)
    * *app_service_plan_name* (app service plan shared by both UI and API)
    * *storage_act_name* (storage account used by the funcion)
    * *aad_tenant_id* (ID of the Azure Active Directory tenant the UI and API clients are in)
    * *api_client_id* (ID of the client for the Function)
    * *api_client_secret* (Secret for the client for the Function)
    * 
1. Create a new deployment by running ARM template with the parameter file in the resource group created above:

```
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName mygroup -TemplateFile .\template.json -TemplateParameterFile .\parameters.json -Verbose
```

## Final setup steps

1. Update the apiUrl location in **_vars.js_** to point to the function's endpoint

1. Push the code for the front and backend and then navigate to the UI. You should be prompted to log in and then the API will run.
